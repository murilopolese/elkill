Installation:
================================================================================


As I didn't pay the $5 budget to become a Google Chrome Extension Developer, 
I am not able to upload it to extensions gallery and there are two ways to 
install it.

The first one is to enable "Developer Mode". Open Google Chrome Extensions tab 
on your configuration panel by chrome://chrome/extensions/ or open the Chrome 
configurations and switch to extenions panel on the menu at the top left corner 
Checking the "Developer Mode" box you will be able to load an expanded extension. 
Download it from GitHub, load and have fun.

The second one is easier and much more secure. Download and unpack the extension 
file in the link below this instructions, open the Google Chrome Extensions tab 
as explained above and finally drag and drop the elKill.crx to the extension 
page.
